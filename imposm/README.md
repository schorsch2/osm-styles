## Using the dump-pg.sh tool to build a PostgreSQL database dump that can be restored on Windows

The [imposm 3](https://imposm.org/) utility used to turn the binary OSM dump into a layered, optimized PostgreSQL database for GeoServer currently runs only on Linux.
However you mind want to run PostgreSQL (and possibly GeoServer too) on Windows instead.

This folder contains a small utility, called ``dump-pg.sh``, that can be used to prepare a OSM database dump on a Linux machine, which can then be restored on a Windows machine.

In order to use it, one need to have Docker installed and running, as the PostGIS database 
will run in a local Docker container.


The command self-describes as follows (when run without parameters):

```
Usage dump-pg.sh -i osm_pbf_location [-p postgresqlPort] [-c postgresqlContainerName]
  -i Location of the PBF file to import
  -p Local port to use for the PostgreSQL container, defaults to 25432
  -v Version of the Kartoza PostGIS Image to be used, defaults to 12.1
  -c Name of the container used for the PostgreSQL container, defaults to osm-postgis
  -r Remove the database container and its data after import, either true or false, defaults to true
```

For the restore to work properly attention must be paid to the **version numbers**, PostgreSQL can
restore a backup made from the same version, from earlier versions, but not from later version.
For example, if the target PostgreSQL running on Windows is a version 11, doing a backup using version 11 or 10 will work, but a backup from version 12 may fail to restore.  

The Kartoza PostGIS images used to run the import and backup can be [found on dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/kartoza/postgis/tags) with a variety of versions of PostgreSQL and PostGIS to choose from.


### Running the import and database dump

1. Download the desired area from the [GeoFabrik server](https://download.geofabrik.de/). For doing quick tests, a small country is preferred, e.g., [Albania](https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/albania-latest.osm.pbf).
2. Go on the terminal, and change into the ``osm-styles/imposm`` directory.
3. Run the tool from the command line, specifying the location of the PBF file, e.g.:

```
./dump-pg.sh -i /path/to/albania-latest.osm.pbf 
```
4. Wait for the processing to occurr, the output will look similar to:

```

----------- Shutting down the database container
osm-postgis

----------- Deleting the database container
osm-postgis
Backup available at /home/user/.../osm-styles/imposm/work/gis.backup
```
   
4. If all worked, the backup is available at ``work/gis.backup``
   
In case or script failure, the PostgreSQL database might be left up and running, if you don't care about its contents and want to start over, the container can be removed using ``docker rm``, e.g.:

   ``docker rm --force osm-postgis ``
   
### Restoring on a Windows machine

These restore instructions assume you have pgAdmin 4 installed, and the backup file has been moved to the Windows machine already.

1. Create a database named ``osm``

![Create database](images/win-create-db.png)
  
![Confirm database name](images/win-create-db-dialog.png)

2. Right click on the ``osm`` database, choose "Restore", select the database dump and disable importing users and privileges:

![Restore database menu](images/win-restore.png)
  
![Confirm backup location](images/win-restore-dialog-1.png)

![Disable users and privilege import](images/win-restore-dialog-2.png)

3. Run the restore.

After doing this, go back to the [general instructions](../README.md) and finish setting up GeoServer.
The imposm run includes moving tables from the "import" to the "public" schema, so the "public" schema should be used for the GeoServer configuration.
